  \item
    to borrow money and to charge the whole or any part of the property

    2006, if it wishes to mortgage land;
  \item
    to co-operate with other charities, voluntary bodies and statutory

  \item
    to acquire, merge with or to enter into any partnership or joint
    venture arrangement with any other charity;

    to set aside income as a reserve against future expenditure but
    only in accordance with a written policy about reserves;
  \item
    to employ and remunerate such staff as are necessary for carrying
    out the work of the charity. The charity may employ or remunerate a
    director only to the extent it is permitted to do so by article \ref{cls:income-property}
    and provided it complies with the conditions in that article;
  \item
    to:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item
      deposit or invest funds;
    \item
      employ a professional fund-manager; and
    \item
      arrange for the investments or other property of the charity to be
      held in the name of a nominee; in the same manner and subject to
      the same conditions as the trustees of a trust are permitted to do
      by the Trustee Act 2000;

\section{Application of Income and Property}

\item
  \label{cls:income-property}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
    The income and property of the charity shall be applied solely
    towards the promotion of the Objects.
  \item
    \label{scls:director-reimburse}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item
      A director is entitled to be reimbursed from the property of the
      charity or may pay out of such property reasonable expenses
      properly incurred by him or her when acting on behalf of the
      charity.
    \item
      A director may benefit from trustee indemnity insurance cover
      purchased at the charity's expense in accordance with, and subject

    \item
      A director may receive an indemnity from the charity in the
      circumstances specified in article \ref{cls:directors-indemnity}.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    None of the income or property of the charity may be paid or
    transferred directly or indirectly by way of dividend bonus or
    otherwise by way of profit to any member of the charity. This does
    not prevent a member who is not also a director receiving:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item
      a benefit from the charity in the capacity of a beneficiary of the
      charity;
    \item
      reasonable and proper remuneration for any goods or services
      supplied to the charity.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    \label{scls:directors-remuneration} No director or connected person
    may:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item
      buy any goods or services from the charity on terms preferential to
      those applicable to members of the public;
    \item
      sell goods, services, or any interest in land to the charity;
    \item
      be employed by, or receive any remuneration from, the charity;
    \item
      receive any other financial benefit from the charity; unless:
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item
        the payment is permitted by article \ref{scls:directors-scope}; or
      \item
        the directors obtain the prior written approval of the Commission
        and fully comply with any procedures it prescribes. In this article
        a `financial benefit' means a benefit, direct or indirect, which is
        either money or has a monetary value.
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    \label{scls:directors-scope}
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item
      A director or connected person may receive a benefit from the
      charity as a beneficiary provided it is available generally to the
      beneficiaries of the charity.
    \item
      A director or connected person may enter into a contract for the
      supply of services, or of goods that are supplied in connection
      with the provision of services, to the charity where that is
      permitted in accordance with, and subject to the conditions in
      section 73A to 73C of the Charities Act 1993.
    \item
      Subject to article \ref{scls:supply-goods} a director or connected
      person may provide the charity with goods that are not supplied in
      connection with services provided to the charity by the director or
      connected person. \label{art:directors-goods}
    \item
      A director or connected person may receive interest on money lent
      to the charity at a reasonable and proper rate which must be 2\%
      (or more) per annum below the base rate of a clearing bank to be
      selected by the directors.
    \item
      A director or connected person may receive rent for premises let by
      the director or connected person to the charity if the amount of
      the rent and the other terms of the lease are reasonable and proper
      and provided that the director concerned shall withdraw from any
      meeting at which such a proposal or the rent or other terms of the
      lease are under discussion.
    \item
      The directors may arrange for the purchase, out of the funds of the
      charity, of insurance designed to indemnify the directors in
      accordance with the terms of, and subject to the conditions in,
      section 73F of the Charities Act 1993.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item \label{goods}
    \label{scls:supply-goods} The charity and its directors may only
    rely upon the authority provided by article
    \ref{art:directors-goods} if each of the following conditions is
    satisfied:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item
      The amount or maximum amount of the payment for the goods is set
      out in an agreement in writing between:
      \begin{enumerate}
      \item
        the charity or its directors (as the case may be); and
      \item
        the director or connected person supplying the goods
        (``the supplier'') under which the supplier is to supply the goods
        in question to or on behalf of the charity.
      \end{enumerate}
    \item
      The amount or maximum amount of the payment for the goods does not
      exceed what is reasonable in the circumstances for the supply of
      the goods in question.
    \item
      The other directors are satisfied that it is in the best interests
      of the charity to contract with the supplier rather than with
      someone who is not a director or connected person. In reaching that
      decision the directors must balance the advantage of contracting
      with a director or connected person against the disadvantages of
      doing so.
    \item
      The supplier is absent from the part of any meeting at which there
      is discussion of the proposal to enter into a contract or
      arrangement with him or her or it with regard to the supply of
      goods to the charity.
    \item
      The supplier does not vote on any such matter and is not to be
      counted when calculating whether a quorum of directors is present
      at the meeting.
    \item
      The reason for their decision is recorded by the directors in the
      minute book.
    \item
      A majority of the directors then in office are not in receipt of
      remuneration or payments authorised by article
      \ref{scls:directors-remuneration}.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item \label{def-charity}

      grandparent, brother or sister of the director;
    \item
      \label{art:connected-spouse} the spouse or civil partner of the
      director or of any person falling within paragraph (i) above;
    \item
      \label{art:connected-business} a person carrying on business in
      partnership with the director or with any person falling within
      paragraph (i) or (ii)above;

        by two or more persons falling within sub-paragraph (A), when taken
        together
      \end{enumerate}
    \item
      a body corporate in which –
      \begin{enumerate}
        \item
            the director or any connected person falling within paragraphs (i) to (iii) has a substantial interest; or
        \item
            two or more persons falling within sub-paragraph (A) who, when
            taken together, have a substantial interest.
      \end{enumerate}
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    For the purposes of interpreting the terms used in sub-clauses \ref{def-charity}
    and \ref{def-connected}, paragraphs 2 to 4 of Schedule 5 to the Charities Act 1993
    apply.

\section{Content of Proxy Notices}

\item \label{proxies}
  \begin{enumerate}

    Proxies may only validly be appointed by a notice in writing (a

    interests where the following conditions apply:

      charity to authorise the conflict of interests in the circumstances
      applying.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item \label{conflict-interest-loyalty}
    In this article a conflict of interests arising because of a duty
    of loyalty owed to another organisation or person only refers to

      that director being counted in the quorum; the decision has been
      made by a majority of the directors at a quorate meeting.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item \label{directors-validity-void}
    Article \ref{directors-validity} does not permit a director or a connected person to
    keep any benefit that may be conferred upon him or her by a
    resolution of the directors or of a committee of directors if, but

    director has not complied with article \ref{directors-interests}.

  the directors or of a committee of directors authorised by the
