\section{Content of Proxy Notices}

\item \label{proxies}
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
    Proxies may only validly be appointed by a notice in writing (a
    ``proxy notice'') which -
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item
      states the name and address of the member appointing the proxy;
    \item
      identifies the person appointed to be that member's proxy and the
      general meeting in relation to which that person is appointed;
    \item
      is signed by or on behalf of the member appointing the proxy, or is
      authenticated in such manner as the directors may determine; and

      is delivered to the association in accordance with the articles and any
      instructions contained in the notice of the general meeting to
      which they relate.

  \item
    The association may require proxy notices to be delivered in a
    particular form, and may specify different forms for different
    purposes.

    Proxy notices may specify how the proxy appointed under them is to
    vote (or that the proxy is to abstain from voting) on one or more
    resolutions.
  \item
    Unless a proxy notice indicates otherwise, it must be treated as -
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item
      allowing the person appointed under it as a proxy discretion as to
      how to vote on any ancillary or procedural resolutions put to the
      meeting; and
    \item
      appointing that person as a proxy in relation to any adjournment of
      the general meeting to which it relates as well as the meeting
      itself.
    \end{enumerate}
  \end{enumerate}

\section{Delivery of Proxy Notices}

\item
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item
        A person who is entitled to attend, speak or vote
        (either on a show of hands or on a poll) at a general meeting
        remains so entitled in respect of that meeting or any adjournment
        of it, even though a valid proxy notice has been delivered to the
        association by or on behalf of that person.
        \item
        An appointment under a
        proxy notice may be revoked by delivering to the association a notice
        in writing given by or on behalf of the person by whom or on whose
        behalf the proxy notice was given. 
        \item
        A notice revoking a proxy
        appointment only takes effect if it is delivered before the start
        of the meeting or adjourned meeting to which it relates 
        \item
        If a
        proxy notice is not executed by the person appointing the proxy, it

\section{Proceedings of Directors}

\item
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item
    The Directors may from time to time specify a web based system (``the
    Governance System'') for recording and managing their decision making process.
    \item
    The Governance System must:
        \begin{enumerate}
            \item
             permit any director to create a proposal that is then available for viewing (on
             presentation of suitable credentials) by all directors and any member of the
             Association;
            \item
            after a proposal has been created, send it promptly to each director's email address;
            \item
             maintain one or more rules as to the period (``the voting period'') within which any
             proposal must be accepted or rejected, which may vary from proposal to proposal;
            \item
             during the voting period, permit any director to indicate whether they accept or reject
             the proposal;
            \item
             record the votes cast by each director;
            \item
             record that a proposal has been ``passed'' if the requisite number of directors have
             indicated their acceptance of the proposal via the governance system;
            \item
             permit the recording of minutes; and
            \item
             maintain a current contact email address for each director (``the director's email
             address'').
        \end{enumerate}
    \item
    Any proposal that has been recorded as ``passed'' by the Governance System shall
    be treated as a decision of the directors.
    \item
    The Governance System to be used on the adoption of these articles shall be that
    supplied by One Click Orgs and accessed on the World Wide Web at the address
    http://london-gov.hackspace.org.uk
  \end{enumerate}

\item
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item
    Decisions of the directors may be made either:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item
        by the use of the Governance System; or
        \item
        by a written resolution in accordance with the procedure described below.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item
    All directors' decisions must be made in one of these two ways, and a decision
    made in any other way will be ineffective.
    \item
    A majority of the directors must accept a proposal made using the
    Governance System or a written resolution before it is passed.
  \end{enumerate}

\item
    A written resolution may be passed if:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item
        the text of the resolution is circulated to all directors in writing; and
        \item
        the requisite number of directors have given to all the other directors in writing their
        agreement to the text of the resolution.
    \end{enumerate}

    \item
        The directors may delegate any of their powers or functions concerning the day
        to day management of the affairs of the Company to any person or persons as they may
        from time to time select.
    \item
        All acts done by a director shall, even if it is afterwards discovered that there was
        a defect in their appointment or that they were disqualified from holding office or had
        vacated office, be as valid as if such person had been duly appointed and was qualified
        and had continued to be a director.
    \item
        Where on any particular occasion more than 2 directors, in the course of their
        office as directors, discuss the affairs of the Company by any means, whether in person
        or otherwise, a minute shall be made and recorded indicating:
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item
                    when the discussion took place;
                \item
                    the identities of the directors involved; and
                \item
                    the substance of the discussion.
            \end{enumerate}
    \item
        Minutes of directors meetings:
            \begin{enumerate}
                \item
                    may be held in electronic form, and in particular using the Governance System;
                \item
                    must be held for ten years from the date of the discussion in accordance with section
                    248 of the Companies Act 2006.

    \end{enumerate}

\section{Delegation}

\item
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
    The directors may delegate any of their powers or functions to a
    committee of two or more directors but the terms of any delegation
    must be recorded in the minute book.
  \item
    The directors may impose conditions when delegating, including the
    conditions that:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item
      the relevant powers are to be exercised exclusively by the
      committee to whom they delegate;
    \item
      no expenditure may be incurred on behalf of the association except in
      accordance with a budget previously agreed with the directors.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item
    The directors may revoke or alter a delegation.

\section{Declaration of Directors' Interests}

\item \label{directors-interests}
  A director must declare the nature and extent of any interest,
  direct or indirect, which he or she has in a proposed transaction
  or arrangement with the association or in any transaction or
  arrangement entered into by the association which has not previously
  been declared. A director must absent himself or herself from any
  discussions of the directors in which it is possible that a
  conflict will arise between his or her duty to act solely in the
      interests of the association and any personal interest (including but
  not limited to any personal financial interest).

\section{Conflicts of Interests}

\item 
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item
    If a conflict of interests arises for a director because of a duty
    of loyalty owed to another organisation or person and the conflict
    is not authorised by virtue of any other provision in the articles,
    the unconflicted directors may authorise such a conflict of
    interests where the following conditions apply:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item
      the conflicted director is absent from the part of the meeting at
      which there is discussion of any arrangement or transaction
      affecting that other organisation or person;
    \item
      the conflicted director does not vote on any such matter and is not
      to be counted when considering whether a quorum of directors is
      present at the meeting; and
    \item
      the unconflicted directors consider it is in the interests of the
      association to authorise the conflict of interests in the circumstances
      applying.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item \label{conflict-interest-loyalty}
    In this article a conflict of interests arising because of a duty
    of loyalty owed to another organisation or person only refers to
    such a conflict which does not involve a direct or indirect benefit
    of any nature to a director.
  \end{enumerate}

\section{Validity of Directors' Decisions}

\item
  \begin{enumerate}
  \item \label{directors-validity}

    participation in any vote of a director:
    \begin{enumerate}
    \item
      who was disqualified from holding office;
    \item
      who had previously retired or who had been obliged by the
      constitution to vacate office;
    \item
      who was not entitled to vote on the matter, whether by reason of a
      conflict of interests or otherwise; if without:
    \item
      the vote of that director; and
    \item
      that director being counted in the quorum; the decision has been
      made by a majority of the directors at a quorate meeting.
    \end{enumerate}
  \item \label{directors-validity-void}
    Article \ref{directors-validity} does not permit a director to
    keep any benefit that may be conferred upon him or her by a
    resolution of the directors or of a committee of directors if, but
    for article \ref{directors-validity}, the resolution would have been void, or if the
    director has not complied with article \ref{directors-interests}.
  \end{enumerate}
